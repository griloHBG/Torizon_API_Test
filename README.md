To use this script, a commercial account at [Torizon Platform](https://app.torizon.io) is needed.

This is a simple script meant to use Torizon API Test.

Right now, the branch main uses the V1 API.

API Reference: https://developer.toradex.com/torizon-platform-services/torizon-platform-api/

The script expects the following variables to be exported among the environment variables:
- `TORIZON_API_CLIENT_ID`: this is the API ID that you will get when you create an API Client in Torizon Platform Dashboard
- `TORIZON_API_CLIENT_SECRET`: this is the API secret that you will get when you create an API Client in Torizon Platform Dashboard. It will be showed to you only once!
